Gucci, Louis, Fendi
Won't help me heal 'cause without you I'm just empty
Swimming in tears, baby, ever since you left me
I been so lonely and this pain been hitting heavy

I'm always Gucci, Louis, Fendi
Won't help me heal 'cause without you I'm just empty (Yeah)
Swimming in tears, baby, ever since you left me (Ever since you left me)
I been so lonely and this pain been hitting heavy (Aye, yeah)

[Verse 1: YOUNG XAV]
All this Gucci, Louis, Fendi
Never changing how we left things
Scrolling through your feed on Instagram
Your pics pull heart strings
Just because it still stings doesn’t mean I can’t forget you
Trust I try to often, my choice not to is the issue, yeah
Fuck, bloodshot eyes, it’s 3am, I’m drunk as fuck
I draft a couple texts, but none be worded well enough
The hangover the next day got me feeling hella rough
But my plane be boarding shortly
Find it hard to keep in touch
F-R-E-E time with me was non-existent
Chose to chase the wrong things
Know my love was inconsistent
Sex, drugs, Rock-n-Roll
No way I could resist it
Love for my career the only thing that be persistent
Yeah, she said that I’m obsessed with being wanted
Some text book narcissism if we’re both to be quite honest
I never kept it secret
Made it clear whatchu’d put up with
