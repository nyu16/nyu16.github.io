# Summary

I've had three months of internship experience at Han-A Urban Research Institute. I was tasked with aiding in data collection, creating power point presentations, field research, and case studies. During my 2 years of service at the Republic of Korean Army, I was dispatched to Incheon Internation Airport on a translation mission, and aided in the COVID19 screening station and explaining disease control guidelines. In July 2020, I conceptualized an upcycling business plan in a start-up contest held in the ROKA. Upcycling and working on environmental projects were my passions and my team contested up until the quarter-finals. Here's the website that I created at the time.
